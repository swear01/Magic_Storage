# Typed Resource Storage Architecture

> Status: implemented foundation under GitHub [#9](https://github.com/swear01/Magic_Storage/issues/9). Item, fluid, NeoForge Energy, optional Mekanism chemical, and registered addon kinds now share one live ledger and transaction domain. Terminal listing and its resource selector, passive Bus capabilities, Creative unlimited type capacity, the public resource-kind API, and deterministic typed recipe families are connected.

## Product boundary

Magic Storage owns stored resources and executes supported recipes immediately inside its server-owned transaction engine. It does not export ingredients to an external machine and wait for that machine to finish.

Items, fluids, NeoForge Energy, and Mekanism chemicals are the first required kinds. They are not a closed enum. Future addons must be able to register other deterministic resources without adding another hardcoded Core field.

## Universal identity

Every stored entry has:

- a stable resource-kind ID;
- a stable resource ID inside that kind;
- exact amount-independent variant data;
- a non-negative `long` amount.

The initial internal key is deliberately independent from optional-mod Java classes. Persistence and atomic planning can therefore retain an unavailable kind as raw keyed data when its provider mod is missing. A kind-specific bridge converts between this universal identity and an `ItemStack`, `FluidStack`, energy value, `ChemicalStack`, or future addon value.

Variant data is part of identity. Item and fluid components cannot be discarded or normalized to registry defaults. Resource bridges must produce one canonical representation and must reject malformed or lossy values rather than guessing.

## Required resource kinds

### Item

- Identity: exact item registry ID plus exact data components.
- Amount: item count as `long`.
- `ItemKey` remains the exact item adapter, but live counts are stored only in the universal ledger. The old segmented item NBT is now a persistence compatibility encoding, not a second runtime map.

### Fluid

- Identity: exact fluid registry ID plus exact `FluidStack` components.
- Amount: NeoForge fluid units as `long` internally; each `IFluidHandler` call remains bounded to its `int` contract.
- External access uses NeoForge `Capabilities.FluidHandler` and honors `SIMULATE`/`EXECUTE` return values.

### Power

- Identity: the NeoForge Energy resource ID with no variant payload.
- Amount: FE as `long` internally; each `IEnergyStorage` call remains bounded to `int`.
- This pool is separate from Magic Storage's recipe process/Fuel reserves. They cannot silently convert into one another.

### Chemical

- Identity: exact Mekanism chemical registry ID.
- The persisted resource-kind ID remains `mekanism:chemical` for compatibility with 0.1.31 worlds. The built-in registry entry is exposed through a NeoForge alias from `mekanism:chemical` to `magic_storage:chemical`; do not rename it or silently migrate saved keys.
- Amount: chemical amount as `long`.
- The compatibility module uses `ChemicalStack` and `IChemicalHandler` only when Mekanism is present. The normal build and dedicated server must remain safe when it is absent.
- The player-facing dependency is not pinned to the one representative version exercised by CI. No Mekanism multi-version CI matrix is planned; incompatibilities outside that representative fixture are handled from user reports.

## Ledger and transaction rules

- A transaction is a finite map of exact resource keys to signed deltas.
- Simulation validates every delta, underflow, overflow, type-capacity transition, source, destination, and provider rule without mutation.
- Commit revalidates the same transaction and applies every kind or none.
- Failed mixed-kind transactions cannot leave an item consumed while a fluid, power, chemical, remainder, or output was not committed.
- Exact insertion/extraction APIs reject invalid amounts. Bounded capability APIs may return a smaller accepted amount only when their contract explicitly allows it.
- Every successful mutation marks the Core changed and emits listeners only after the mutation batch is complete.
- Type capacity counts every non-zero exact resource key, independent of kind. Total-capacity policy remains kind-specific and must be explicit; no implicit item-to-fluid conversion factor is allowed.

## Resource-kind registration boundary

`StorageResourceKindApi.createDeferredRegister(modId)` registers stable kind IDs in `magic_storage:resource_kind` during normal NeoForge loading. A kind declares whether exact variant payloads are legal and supplies a non-empty representative item. Addons construct canonical `StorageResourceKey` values and may expose them through `StorageResourceCapabilities.BLOCK`; built-in helpers create and decode exact item/fluid keys and the singleton NeoForge Energy key. `StorageResourceBlockApi` and `StorageResourceContainerApi` register one deterministic bridge per kind for, respectively, adjacent block capabilities and a single held item container.

Registration does not grant Core/player mutation callbacks. `StorageResourceHandler` exposes bounded list/amount/insert/extract operations; `StorageResourceTransaction` is the only public multi-key mutation request. Magic Storage still owns validation, capacity, persistence, synchronization, and all-or-nothing commit. Missing providers remain raw on disk and are omitted from terminal presentation until their kind is registered again; new live mutations reject unregistered kinds instead of guessing or fabricating a representative.

Terminal entries carry the exact key and long amount in display-only metadata. A server-owned menu value selects exactly one presentation group: Item, Fluid, NeoForge Energy, Mekanism Chemical/Gas, or Other. Other contains registered addon kinds not promoted to a built-in group; missing providers remain omitted. The selector appears on Storage views in both terminal types, resets to Item, and is hidden/rejected on Craftable and Fuel. Clicking a non-item representative never extracts its icon or selects an item recipe, and EMI excludes those representatives from item inputs. A player may deposit into or withdraw from a supported fluid, FE, chemical, or addon container held on the cursor; the server rejects spectator, stale, wrong-view, hidden-slot, out-of-range, and otherwise invalid-menu packets before mutation, plans against a private one-item copy, simulates Core capacity, then atomically commits the Core delta and exact replacement container. Cursor/inventory placement and the Core delta share one mutation batch, so listeners cannot observe a half-committed transfer. It never stores container state on the client.

Directional Import and Export Buses scan the front block for both the generic addon capability and every matching native fluid/FE/chemical endpoint; a block exposing generic mana and native fluid at the same time therefore transfers both rather than letting the generic endpoint mask the native one. Passive Import is insert-only. Directionless Export exposes filtered extract-only generic/native capabilities plus a safe one-slot item view capped to a normal stack. Generic typed capability paths reject the Item kind so item automation cannot bypass `IItemHandler` stack limits. Existing item rules are not reinterpreted as typed filters: non-item resources pass under empty `DENY`, while item-only `ALLOW` rules match no typed resource. Creative Storage makes the same shared type domain unlimited for every kind.

### Public handler and strategy contract

Addon implementations are part of the transaction boundary and must obey all of these rules:

- `StorageResourceHandler.getStoredResources()` returns a non-null, finite snapshot of unique exact keys. Its order must be deterministic; the list and its keys must not change after return.
- `getAmount(key)` returns a non-negative exact amount for that key and `0` for an unsupported key.
- `insert` and `extract` accept only positive requests, return a value in `0..requested`, and return `0` for a wrong kind. `simulate=true` must not mutate any block, item, capability, cache, or listener-visible state. `simulate=false` mutates exactly the returned amount and never more.
- A handler must remain internally consistent for one call, but Magic Storage still revalidates mutable Core, topology, side, mode, filter, security, and capacity state between simulation and commit. A dishonest handler that mutates during simulation or reports an amount different from its mutation violates the addon API; Magic Storage does not guess how to repair an unknowable external state.
- `StorageResourceBlockStrategy.find(level, pos, side)` must honor the exact queried side, must not load a chunk, and returns empty when that kind is unavailable. Generic and native endpoints may coexist and are visited in stable registration/kind order. Re-resolving the same live capability during one simulate-to-commit attempt must return an endpoint whose handler is identity-stable or equality-stable; a strategy that creates unequal throwaway wrappers for the same unchanged endpoint violates the revalidation contract and is rejected as stale.
- `StorageResourceContainerStrategy` receives a private one-count `ItemStack` copy. It must return a positive exact amount, the same resource kind it registered, and zero or one replacement container. Planning may mutate only that private copy. Magic Storage makes another private copy for every strategy so one rejected strategy cannot poison the next.
- Optional-mod bridges must not link optional classes when the mod is absent. A present but binary-incompatible mod fails explicitly with a `binary-incompatible` error, including a `LinkageError` wrapped by reflective invocation; it is never silently disabled or replaced by another API. Mekanism `IChemicalHandler.isValid(tank, stack)` reports schema/type validity independently of the tank's current contents or capacity. The indexed execute-insert path separately enforces an already-filled tank's exact chemical identity; the generic insertion overload is the path that may select a tank for a new stored chemical type.

Capability objects are stable while their configured side/mode surface remains available. A cached wrapper rechecks the current BlockEntity identity, escrow state, mode, side, automation gate, loaded Core path, conflict state, filter, and actor on every call. A temporarily missing or disconnected Core therefore makes the existing wrapper inert rather than exposing stale storage; configured side/mode changes invalidate the NeoForge capability so discovery can obtain the new surface.

### Bus rollback and escrow

All item and typed Bus operations use simulate-then-commit and a structured `BusActor`. One directional cooldown independently attempts at most one ordinary item stack and one bounded typed-resource transfer; a successful item move does not starve fluid, power, chemical, or addon resources exposed by the same block. Recursive same-network or inverse re-entry is rejected by a `try/finally` execution guard. Ordinary items use `BusItemTransferPlan`; typed resources use the corresponding typed immutable plan. Both capture the exact Bus/config revision, Core/network identity, conflict state, topology revision, loaded path, endpoint block state, queried side, endpoint identity, and actor, then revalidate before commit and again after every external execute callback that can mutate the world. Import never restores into a source handler that was detached during execute; every item or typed amount already extracted is preserved through the current Bus escrow/recovery path. Export first reverse-extracts a replaced target's reversible accepted amount and returns it to Core; if the detached target refuses reclaim, the exact unreclaimed item amount is emitted through the recovery path instead of being treated as delivered. Any remainder that Core cannot immediately restore is likewise preserved. Both Import and Export use the same ten-tick missing-Core negative cache. While escrow is pending, cached and fresh passive capabilities are inert. The Bus drains escrow back to the same Core with the structured Bus actor before any later automation, even when automation is disabled or the Bus is directionless.

Escrow is saved in the Bus BlockEntity and owner-stripped Bus drop. Each live Bus has a distinct recovery UUID that is copied into its drop solely for exact deduplication; two removals at the same position with identical escrow remain two operations, while loot-first plus `onRemove` for one Bus remains one drop. Wrench removal, normal breaking, Creative no-drop removal, explosions, direct replacement with air or another block, and failed removal all recover to the Core first or preserve the exact escrow in one recovery drop. A highest-priority global `BlockDropsEvent` handler removes an escrow-bearing Bus from the mutable event list and directly conserves it before later listeners can consume or cancel the drop. Emergency conservation is therefore independent of event cancellation and `doTileDrops`; a canceled Wrench event also preserves a plain Bus item. An operation that cannot conserve the resource refuses removal. A stale execute callback must never write into a detached/replaced BlockEntity: if the original Bus no longer owns the position, the remainder becomes an owner-stripped recovery drop. Legacy owner claim occurs only after this conservation preflight succeeds, and no-op rotation never claims, so failed or ineffective Wrench actions cannot change ownership or revision. Unknown-kind ledger entries and malformed future escrow payloads are retained raw and keep the Bus disabled instead of being deleted. Escrow insertion is atomic at `long` overflow.

## Recipe-family relationship

`RecipeFamilyFactories.deterministicResources(...)` resolves a `TypedRecipePlan` from the current exact recipe holder and server registries. A plan declares one to nine exact inputs, multiple exact outputs, a selectable primary item output, layout, and explicit roles. Inputs may have ordered exact alternatives; overlapping `CONSUME` alternatives use one deterministic max-flow allocation, and each chosen alternative may return its own exact remainder. `CONSUME` multiplies by craft count; `CATALYST` and `TOOL` are retained and reusable across a batch; `PRIMARY` item outputs follow the selected Player/Storage destination, while non-item outputs and typed remainders return to Core. Checked multiplication, descriptor station work/Fuel, destination capacity, every consumed item/non-item, and every Core output are simulated and committed as one ledger transaction.

Current built-in optional recipe bridges are Farmer's Delight Cooking Pot and Mekanism Crushing, Enriching, Smelting, Combining, plus deterministic item-output Pressurized Reaction. Pressurized Reaction consumes exact item/fluid/chemical keys, total recipe-specific FE (`energyRequired × duration`), and descriptor station work in one plan and may return a chemical co-output. Chemical-only terminal outputs and chance/per-tick-use families remain unsupported.

Chance, dynamic world/player callbacks, arbitrary mutation callbacks, and external-machine send-and-wait remain unsupported. Multi-step graph planning is still future work under GitHub [#1](https://github.com/swear01/Magic_Storage/issues/1).

## Delivery phases

1. **Implemented:** universal key, delta, ledger, persistence, simulation, and atomic commit algebra.
2. **Implemented:** item live-ledger bridge with exact components and legacy segmented-NBT compatibility.
3. **Implemented:** fluid storage plus `IFluidHandler` capability and transfer tests.
4. **Implemented:** NeoForge Energy storage plus `IEnergyStorage` capability and separation tests.
5. **Implemented foundation:** optional Mekanism chemical capability, absent-mod base run, and one representative present-mod GameTest fixture. This is intentionally not a multi-version matrix; other-version incompatibilities are fixed from user reports rather than turning CI into a version guarantee.
6. **Implemented:** typed terminal listings and held-container transfer, generic/native active and passive Bus automation, Creative unlimited type capacity, and addon resource-kind/block/container APIs.
7. **Implemented:** deterministic N-input/N-output typed recipe families. **Future:** bounded multi-step planning.

The current ledger is the Core's only live item/resource transaction domain. Persistence may still encode resolvable items in legacy segmented form so existing worlds remain readable, but load immediately migrates them into the same ledger and rejects duplicate dual representation.

## Verification gates

Every phase starts RED-first. The final phase gate remains:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew runGameTestServer
./gradlew runRecipeAddonGameTestServer
./gradlew runMekanismGameTestServer
./gradlew runIronFurnacesGameTestServer
./gradlew runFarmersDelightGameTestServer
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover scripts
./gradlew runData
```

GUI-visible resource work additionally requires the fullscreen Prism manual gate. Backend ledger work does not claim visual verification.

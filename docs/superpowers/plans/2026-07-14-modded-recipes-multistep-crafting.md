# Modded Recipe Compatibility and Multi-Step Magic Crafting Plan

> Status: the keyed machine-descriptor prerequisite, built-in Phase 1 adapter authority, and initial A+B public family slice are implemented. Ten exact built-in families provide complete one-level contracts. Custom exact class/type families can register the bounded deterministic `singleItemToItem` contract through the public NeoForge recipe-family registry; a separately loaded addon fixture verifies that path. GitHub #9 now precedes the broader API: deterministic N-input/N-output families will use the typed-resource ledger for items, fluids, power, chemicals, catalysts, tools, and remainders. The broader API, real-mod compatibility modules, and multi-step planning/execution are not implemented.

## Goals

1. Support selected third-party recipe and station families without pretending arbitrary recipes are safe.
2. Replace the current fixed recipe/station tables with an explicit, server-owned adapter model that can grow by installed mod.
3. Add deterministic multi-step magic crafting while preserving exact recipe identity, components, remainders, energy, capacity, and rollback.
4. Reuse EMI where its public API is suitable for recipe discovery and visualization, but never make EMI client state authoritative for storage or execution.

## Current boundary

- A mod recipe that uses vanilla shaped, shapeless, cooking, stonecutting, Smithing Transform, or Smithing Trim serializers already produces the exact vanilla recipe classes accepted by Magic Storage; a non-`minecraft` recipe namespace alone does not make it unsupported.
- The initial **A + B** slice is complete: supported standard exact class/type families keep zero-configuration discovery, while addons can register one bounded `singleItemToItem` family through the public `magic_storage:recipe_family` registry. One family registration covers all its recipe IDs.
- Custom recipe classes/types outside that registered one-input deterministic contract remain fail-closed today. Fluids and chemicals are approved future explicit resource roles through GitHub #9; dynamic/chance outputs and world/player/event-dependent side effects remain out of scope.
- `CraftableRecipeCatalog` now consumes exact built-in adapter classifications and an explicit candidate coverage result. Simple ingredient representatives are exhaustive; non-simple/custom representatives and Smithing predicate scans are conservatively non-exhaustive and therefore remain in the unindexed candidate set so a valid recipe is not omitted before its real predicate is reached.
- `BuiltInRecipeAdapters` remains the policy authority for built-in families. `RecipeAdapterSnapshot` appends validated external families after built-ins and adds their exact recipe types to server discovery. `CraftingTerminalMenu` consumes normalized matches and owns only joint reservation, destination delivery, capacity checks, mutation, and rollback; external families receive no Core/player mutation callback.
- The Fuel layout and public `magic_storage:machine_descriptor` registry are descriptor-count-driven and paged. Core state persists by stable descriptor ID, menu opening uses a cached server snapshot plus a fixed 256-slot parity bank, and unavailable addon-item NBT is retained for later reload. Recipe-family registration remains separate and is not implied by a machine descriptor.

## EMI source audit

The minimum development dependency is EMI `1.1.24+1.21.1`; this is not an exact player runtime pin. Released clients accept compatible EMI 1.x builds through `[1.1.24,2)`, while dedicated servers do not require EMI.

- The public `EmiRecipeManager` exposes recipes and input/output lookup, and `EmiRecipe#supportsRecipeTree()` identifies recipes that can participate in EMI's tree.
- Public `EmiApi.viewRecipeTree()` only opens EMI's tree screen. Public `focusRecipe(...)` only focuses an already-open recipe screen.
- Creating a tree goal and reading the tree use `BoM.setGoal(...)`, `MaterialTree`, and related `dev.emi.emi.bom` classes. Those classes exist in the runtime jar but are absent from the API artifact and are therefore internal implementation details.
- NeoForge 1.21.1 keeps authoritative recipes in the server `RecipeManager`; recipes are not generally synchronized to the client. That matches this project's server-authority rule.

**Decision:** EMI's tree is useful immediately as a player-facing planning/reference screen, but it is not a supported library API for exporting a craft graph or seeding a goal. Magic Storage must not link `dev.emi.emi.bom`, reflect into it, serialize its client tree, or trust it for execution. If EMI later exposes a public tree/goal API, the client bridge may consume it; the server still rebuilds and validates its own plan.

## Proposed architecture

### 1. Normalized recipe execution adapters

Introduce an internal adapter registry keyed by stable adapter ID. Each adapter owns the complete contract for one recipe family:

- whether an exact `RecipeHolder<?>` is supported;
- ordered input predicates, whether candidate representatives are exhaustive, catalysts/tools, remainders, and per-craft multiplicity;
- exact output assembly from the chosen full-component source stacks;
- required station descriptor and process/Fuel/tool costs;
- presentation kind/representatives;
- simulation and commit validation.

The existing vanilla families move behind adapters without changing behavior first. There is no generic `Recipe#getIngredients()` fallback: an unknown recipe is unsupported until an adapter proves its complete contract.

The implemented expansion layer starts with `singleItemToItem`: one non-empty ingredient consumed once, deterministic exact output, one existing station descriptor, free or existing `EnergyCost`, no remainder, and an existing presentation kind. The opaque registry value never exposes storage, player, allocation, or commit authority. This is a verified bootstrap contract, not the intended final family shape. After GitHub #9, the public contract becomes bounded deterministic N-input/N-output typed-resource declarations that explicitly model every consumed input, produced output, component, catalyst, tool, remainder, fluid, power, chemical, and cost. The API removes per-mod transaction boilerplate; it never infers unknown semantics by reflection, names, EMI widgets, serializer JSON, or generic `Recipe#getIngredients()`.

The completed built-in slice keeps `RecipeAdapterRegistry` keyed by stable `ResourceLocation`, rejects duplicate IDs, orders by priority then ID, binds each match to the exact holder instance, and recognizes only the exact shaped, shapeless, four cooking, stonecutting, Smithing Transform, Smithing Trim, and internal axe-transformation classes. Every successful match also carries ordered predicates and multiplicity, a stable station descriptor ID, process/Fuel/tool costs, checked component-sensitive output and remainders, presentation semantics, source-backed variant resolution, and simulation/commit validators. Smithing Transform and Trim enumerate only exact currently available template/base/addition stacks in canonical registry/component order and fail closed above 65,536 combinations. Trim assembly must resolve its pattern/material in the current registry context and may expose multiple exact output identities under one recipe ID. Every lookup, select, preview, Max, execute, and EMI request resolves the current holder by recipe ID; selected Smithing variants are then rebound by exact output identity, and a replaced same-ID holder still fails the in-flight identity check. Transform's generic target-result lookup remains an explicit discovery-only compatibility path and still executes a source-bound exact variant. There is no generic family fallback. Adapters are pure policy/validation and never mutate Core; the existing menu reservation/delivery/capacity/atomic rollback engine remains the only mutation owner.

### 2. Keyed station and energy descriptors (completed prerequisite)

The implemented public registry replaces persistent ordinal identity with stable `ResourceLocation` descriptor IDs. Its frozen descriptor snapshot drives:

- category, representative item, accepted machine/tool predicate, max installed count, and optional energy production;
- recipe adapter/station requirement mapping;
- Core persistence keyed by descriptor ID, with explicit migration from the current numeric slots;
- one fixed 256-slot Core/menu bank plus a paged server-supplied descriptor view; registration never changes client/server container parity;
- bounded menu opening data and payloads so server and client constructors retain identical fixed slot/data counts and order;
- variable reserve values through explicit packets rather than client-owned state or an unbounded `ContainerData` layout;
- Fuel `FlowGrid` pages and exact hitboxes.

Registration freezes before a world/menu can use it. Missing/reordered descriptors recover parseable stacks into ordinary Core storage; raw NBT for an unavailable addon item is retained and retried after later loads. The remaining plan must consume this API rather than replace it.

### 3. Server-owned recipe graph

Build the future planner from normalized server adapters, not from EMI widgets or client recipes. A plan node contains exact recipe ID, adapter ID, chosen input identities/counts, output identities/counts, station/energy costs, remainders, and requested craft count.

Planning rules:

- resolve alternatives deterministically from currently available exact `ItemKey`s, then stable registry/component order;
- reserve existing stock before expanding a missing ingredient into another recipe;
- detect recipe/output cycles by exact identity and report them explicitly;
- enforce configurable-in-code hard bounds for depth, node count, and arithmetic overflow; exceeding a bound is a visible planning failure, not partial crafting;
- account for catalysts, tools, energy, by-products, container remainders, and output capacity;
- keep intermediate products in a virtual working inventory, then simulate the complete net Core/player/cursor delta;
- commit the complete immediate job in one Core mutation batch only after revalidating recipe reload identity, topology, station state, sources, destination, and capacity.

The first multi-step version is immediate and atomic. Queued/asynchronous jobs, crafting CPUs, progress monitors, cross-chunk workers, and persisted partial execution are a separate later design because they require durable reservations and recovery after reload.

### 4. EMI bridge

Keep EMI required on clients, absent from dedicated-server requirements, and limited to public API:

- continue exposing the server-synchronized terminal inventory projection and exact one-level handler;
- add an **Open in EMI** action only through public `EmiApi` calls, so players can inspect/select recipes and use EMI's own recipe tree UI;
- distinguish those actions precisely: public `focusRecipe(...)` can open/focus the selected recipe, while public `viewRecipeTree()` can only open EMI's existing tree screen and cannot seed the selected recipe as a new goal;
- accept only exact backing recipe IDs that the server adapter registry supports;
- when Magic Storage gains its own multi-step request, send only `{containerId, recipeId, amount, destination}` and let the server build the graph;
- never transmit an EMI `MaterialTree`, default-resolution map, or client-calculated material cost as authority.

## TDD implementation phases

### Phase 1 — Built-in adapter authority, no family expansion

1. **Complete:** RED-first dist-neutral tests cover stable keyed IDs, duplicate rejection, priority/ID order, exact family selection, unsupported custom classes, candidate coverage, holder identity, and all mandatory match obligations.
2. **Complete:** nine table-driven GameTests use non-`minecraft` recipe IDs and prove the original families' exact adapter selection, preview, execute, components/output count/remainder, station, concrete cooking energy, and finite/infinite axe deltas. Dedicated `SmithingTrimTests` extends coverage to the tenth family: exact predicates/components/count, source-bound Transform regression, canonical order, bounded-cap fail-closed, multi-variant discovery/selection/execution, current-holder reload, missing station/context, full destination, and rollback.
3. **Complete:** built-in input/output/station/energy/tool/presentation/simulation/commit family policy is behind adapters; the menu retains only the generic transaction engine and reclassifies fresh holders at each operation.
4. **Historical boundary:** this phase intentionally excluded third-party compatibility, public registration, multi-step execution, GUI/resources/lang changes, and EMI tree integration. The initial public registration slice is now completed in Phase 2; the other items remain later work.

### Phase 2 — Generic family factories and first third-party modules

1. **Complete:** expose an opaque NeoForge custom registry and the smallest bounded deterministic `singleItemToItem` factory without adding family-specific branches to the menu or transaction engine.
2. **Complete:** compile the API from a different Java package and independently load a repository-owned addon mod with a custom exact recipe class/type. RED-first GameTests prove station missing/present, custom-type discovery, exact preview/components/count, commit, capacity refusal, rollback, and dedicated-server classloading.
3. **Complete:** reject missing station descriptors and duplicate exact class/type ownership, append external families after built-ins in stable full-ID order, and preserve server-owned lookup/reload/transaction validation.
4. **Pending:** inspect a real mod's source/API before adding a compatibility module. Add its API as `compileOnly` only if source-level integration is required; runtime remains optional. A dedicated CI job is allowed only with a present-mod load assertion plus actual family behavior assertions, and its representative artifact version is not a player-facing exact pin.
5. **Pending:** replace the narrow factory with deterministic N-input/N-output typed-resource contracts after GitHub #9 provides atomic mixed-kind storage. RED tests must cover remainder/catalyst/tool/energy/fluid/chemical/component semantics. No external-machine send-and-wait fallback.

### Phase 3 — Dynamic station descriptors

1. Write migration and menu-parity RED tests first.
2. Introduce stable keyed persistence and an immutable registry snapshot.
3. Synchronize the descriptor snapshot before constructing client slots; keep storage values server-owned.
4. Prove zero/current/capacity/capacity+1/many descriptors stay reachable through Fuel paging and never overlap the reserved type-capacity area.
5. Expose a public third-party registration API only after two internal compatibility modules use the same contract without special cases.

### Phase 4 — EMI planning bridge

1. Test EMI-present client integration and EMI-absent dedicated-server classloading separately.
2. Use only public API calls to open recipe views/tree UI.
3. Keep the existing exact one-level handler as the execution path until the server planner exists.
4. If no public API can perform a requested action, report that boundary; do not reflect into EMI internals.

### Phase 5 — Pure multi-step planner

1. Start with a dist-neutral planner over synthetic adapter fixtures.
2. RED cases: two/three-step chains, output multiplicity, shared intermediates, alternatives, existing partial stock, exact components, non-simple ingredient indexing, catalysts, remainders, energy, cycles, overflow, depth/node/time/payload bounds, and deterministic tie-breaks.
3. Add server RecipeManager integration only after the pure planner is green.
4. Return an immutable plan or a typed failure reason; no partial/default plan.

### Phase 6 — Atomic execution

1. GameTest complete-job simulation against Core plus optional player sources/destinations.
2. Revalidate every step at commit time and apply one net transaction.
3. Test reload/stale recipe, changed station, changed topology, full destination, `Long.MAX_VALUE`, component variants, rollback, and listener reentrancy.
4. Deliver only the requested final output to Player/Cursor when selected; intermediates and remainders follow the simulated Core plan.

### Phase 7 — Multi-step UI and release gate

1. Show a concise plan summary: final amount, missing base resources, required stations/energy, and step count.
2. Use a separate details view for the full tree; do not overload the current one-recipe ledger.
3. Use EMI as the client recipe-browser/tree view and keep a Magic Storage-owned summary for server-planned costs and unsupported synthetic presentations.
4. Run complete automated gates, then the current fullscreen Prism checklist owned by the user.

## First target selection gate

Before any real-mod Phase 2 compatibility module, record the chosen family, representative CI artifact version, Minecraft/loader/API boundary, license/source, recipe type/class, station item, inputs/outputs/remainders, assembly semantics, and optional dependency policy. The tested version is traceability for that CI run, not a supported-version or release restriction. If the behavior cannot be established from source or official API, stop rather than guessing.

## 2026-07-20 external compatibility policy

Optional external integrations such as AE2, Sophisticated Storage, and Mekanism are best-effort interoperability targets. Releases do not require them or restrict players to the version exercised by CI. Each dedicated compatibility job loads one representative version of one target mod and must execute present-mod behavior assertions; the normal build proves absent-mod safety. Passing that one version is treated as representative family-level evidence, not a technical proof for every version, and incompatibilities in untested player combinations are handled from player reports. Main CI also keeps repository-owned addon fixtures and adversarial synthetic handlers for Magic Storage's own contracts. This policy does not replace declared compatibility ranges or reproducible development baselines for Magic Storage's actual build/runtime dependencies.

| Target family | Intended interoperability | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Applied Energistics 2 | Items in `c:tools/wrench` should rotate and safely remove Magic Storage blocks; recipes using exact vanilla classes should remain craftable. Charger remains the second custom-family candidate because it is one item input to one fixed output. | Inscriber is deferred: PRESS consumes optional plates while INSCRIBE retains them, so it needs explicit catalyst/remainder semantics rather than Charger assumptions. |
| Sophisticated Storage | Directional Import, passive Import, and Export should interoperate through the registered `Capabilities.ItemHandler.BLOCK` contract without duplication, loss, slot-order drift, or bypassing Magic Storage filters. | This is bus capability interoperability, not recipe-adapter support. Do not bundle or require Sophisticated Storage or Sophisticated Core. |
| Mekanism | First custom recipe adapter candidate: bounded deterministic Enriching/Crushing and later explicit fluid/chemical families, exact typed inputs/outputs, station/energy, capacity, reload, and rollback. | Chemical/fluid roles require GitHub #9 first. Chance output and machine-world side effects remain unsupported. |

Main CI now independently loads a repository-owned recipe addon fixture that registers a custom `RecipeType` and public family, then executes exact discovery/preview/commit/rollback assertions. The separate machine-descriptor fixture continues to cover process, instant, and consumable descriptor registration. Real-mod compatibility jobs are added only after corresponding integration code and present-mod behavior assertions exist; they fail if the target did not load or the assertions did not run. A recorded test artifact is not a player-facing version pin or compatibility guarantee.

## Non-goals for the first multi-step release

- EMI internal `BoM`/`MaterialTree` linkage or reflection.
- Automatic support for every registered `RecipeType`.
- Fluid/chemical/network side effects without an explicit transaction adapter.
- Chance recipes whose probability/remainder semantics cannot be simulated exactly.
- External-machine orchestration, processing patterns, pattern export/import, or asynchronous send-and-wait crafting. These do not match Magic Storage's installed-station magic-crafting model and are not a fallback for unsupported recipe families.
- Persistent asynchronous jobs, crafting CPUs, monitors, or chunk-loading workers.
- Client-owned storage snapshots or client-authoritative craft plans.

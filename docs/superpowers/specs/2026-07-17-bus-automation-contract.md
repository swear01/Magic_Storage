## Goal

Import and Export Buses form a bounded, server-owned automation boundary around a
Storage Core. They may interoperate with vanilla and modded item, fluid, energy,
chemical, and registered addon-resource handlers, but must never expose the Core as
an unrestricted inventory.

Current behavior is:

- Directional Import actively pulls one item stack and one bounded typed resource
  from its front each cooldown. Import accepts passive insertion only on configured
  physical sides or the separately configured unsided query.
- Directional Export actively pushes one filtered item stack and one bounded typed
  resource through its front. Directionless Export performs no active scan and
  exposes only filtered extract-only capabilities on configured sides/null.
- All transfers remain server-authoritative, currently-loaded-path-only, and
  simulate-then-commit.

## Evidence and boundaries

### Local baseline

- `ImportBusBlockEntity` has front active transfer, stable side/null insert-only
  wrappers, exact item remainder returns, generic/native typed discovery, loaded-path
  validation, and a ten-tick missing-Core backoff.
- `ExportBusBlockEntity` simulates Core extraction and target insertion, exposes a
  safe one-slot item view only in directionless mode, and preserves any typed
  remainder that cannot immediately return to Core in persistent escrow.
- `BusActor` carries structured bus, network, owner, direction, and operation
  identity; `BusTransferGuard` rejects recursive same-network and inverse calls.
- `StorageCoreBlockEntity` is the only live resource owner. A bus holds no normal
  inventory; its escrow is only a lossless recovery ledger for an interrupted
  transfer.
- `WrenchActions` rotates directional buses and routes dismantling through normal
  break/drop hooks.

### External patterns, not copied code

- NeoForge 1.21.1 defines sided block item capabilities and recommends a stable
  cached capability for frequently queried targets:
  [capability documentation](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/1.21.1/inventories/capabilities/).
- NeoForge's `IItemHandler` contract says insertion must not mutate the caller's
  stack and must return the exact remainder; extraction simulation must return a
  safe copy no larger than the request and stack limit:
  [`IItemHandler` at the audited 1.21.1 commit](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/blob/73ab915032bfb2898c82dadabc3f7c4a1ce983bf/src/main/java/net/neoforged/neoforge/items/IItemHandler.java).
- Capability providers must call `Level.invalidateCapabilities(pos)` when an
  existing capability becomes unavailable or a new one becomes available:
  [`RegisterCapabilitiesEvent`](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/blob/73ab915032bfb2898c82dadabc3f7c4a1ce983bf/src/main/java/net/neoforged/neoforge/capabilities/RegisterCapabilitiesEvent.java).
- NeoForge's cache returns `null` rather than loading an unloaded target and
  forbids querying from its invalidation callback:
  [`BlockCapabilityCache`](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/blob/73ab915032bfb2898c82dadabc3f7c4a1ce983bf/src/main/java/net/neoforged/neoforge/capabilities/BlockCapabilityCache.java).
- Refined Storage 2 separates transfer policy from platform handlers, requires an
  importer source to accept rollback, and uses simulate/extract/insert/fallback
  phases:
  [`ImporterSource`](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage2/blob/0643e6f4bc25f12dc01893916c53d393ecdc08d0/refinedstorage-network/src/main/java/com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/api/network/impl/node/importer/ImporterSource.java),
  [`TransferHelper`](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage2/blob/0643e6f4bc25f12dc01893916c53d393ecdc08d0/refinedstorage-storage-api/src/main/java/com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/api/storage/TransferHelper.java), and
  [`ExporterTransferStrategyImpl`](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage2/blob/0643e6f4bc25f12dc01893916c53d393ecdc08d0/refinedstorage-network/src/main/java/com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/api/network/impl/node/exporter/ExporterTransferStrategyImpl.java).
- RS2's tri-state security providers are a useful composition pattern, but Magic
  Storage will not copy that API or make RS2 a dependency:
  [`SecurityDecision`](https://github.com/refinedmods/refinedstorage2/blob/0643e6f4bc25f12dc01893916c53d393ecdc08d0/refinedstorage-network-api/src/main/java/com/refinedmods/refinedstorage/api/network/security/SecurityDecision.java).
- Sophisticated Storage 1.21.x's direct storage and controller handlers are external
  reference targets. Current automated coverage uses adversarial synthetic handlers
  against NeoForge's public item capability; a dedicated present-mod Sophisticated
  job remains optional future compatibility evidence and would not become a
  player-facing version restriction:
  [`StorageBlockEntity`](https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/SophisticatedStorage/blob/9aa6ad5170f8615a192d96c0607d3e4c0dc7e54c/src/main/java/net/p3pp3rf1y/sophisticatedstorage/block/StorageBlockEntity.java) and
  [`ControllerBlockEntity`](https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/SophisticatedStorage/blob/9aa6ad5170f8615a192d96c0607d3e4c0dc7e54c/src/main/java/net/p3pp3rf1y/sophisticatedstorage/block/ControllerBlockEntity.java).

These references are patterns only. Magic Storage keeps its own code, data model,
transactions, and license obligations.

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. The Core remains the sole owner of stored resources. Buses hold configuration
   plus only exact rollback escrow that must be recovered before later transfer.
2. A capability never exposes arbitrary Core slots, counts, insertion, or
   extraction. Every operation passes bus mode, side, filter, security, actor,
   topology, and transaction validation.
3. Client state is presentation only. NBT, filter evaluation, candidate ordering,
   security, simulation, execution, and rollback are server-owned.
4. Neither path validation nor capability discovery may load a chunk.
5. Simulation and execution use the same policy and exact remainder/count
   vocabulary. Execution revalidates all mutable state.
6. An `ItemStack` supplied by another handler is never mutated.
7. Item and typed remainders are restored to their source or Core. If immediate
   restoration becomes impossible, the exact amount is persisted in Bus escrow or
   emitted through the owner-stripped recovery path, passive capabilities become
   inert while escrow is pending, and later automation/removal must recover or
   preserve it. Nothing is silently voided.
8. Conflicted multi-Core networks perform no transfer and expose no extraction.
9. One cooldown moves at most one normal item stack and one bounded typed transfer
   (`1000` native units). Speed upgrades and unbounded bulk transfer are outside
   this issue.
10. Unknown modes, rule types, malformed IDs, missing registry entries, and stale
    packets fail closed and remain visibly diagnosable.

## Authoritative state model

Each bus BlockEntity stores a versioned `busConfig` compound:

```text
schema             int, current 2; schema 1 item-only rules remain readable
mode               "directional" | "directionless"
sideMask           six bits keyed by absolute world Direction
unsidedAccess      boolean
automationEnabled  boolean
filterMode         "allow" | "deny"
filterRules        ordered list, maximum 9; item rules or exact typed resource
owner              optional UUID
configRevision     non-negative long
```

Runtime-only state includes cached Core/path, target capability cache, cooldown,
per-tick operation counter, and the reentrancy guard. Runtime state is never a
source of saved truth.

### Mode and facing

- `FACING` remains a blockstate property and is always rendered.
- `mode` is also represented by a blockstate property so clients can select the
  directional-arrow or neutral-directionless model without receiving private
  configuration.
- `DIRECTIONAL` is the default and preserves the current front transfer.
- `DIRECTIONLESS` performs no active neighbor scan. It is capability-driven only.
  This is the central loop-safety rule; directionless never means "scan all six
  inventories every cooldown".
- Normal Wrench use rotates `FACING` only in `DIRECTIONAL`. It returns `PASS` in
  `DIRECTIONLESS`; mode changes belong to the configuration screen.
- `sideMask` uses absolute world directions and is intentionally unchanged by a
  Wrench rotation. Rotating the active front must not silently move a pipe's
  passive permission to another physical face.
- Reload, piston movement, and a same-state block update preserve the complete
  config. Capability caches are discarded and rebuilt after movement or facing
  change.

### Exact side and capability matrix

`sideMask` controls physical sided capability queries. `unsidedAccess` separately
controls `side == null`; null never bypasses a false unsided setting.

| Bus | Mode | Active tick | Sided capability | Null capability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Import | Directional | pull from `FACING` | insert-only on enabled bits | insert-only iff `unsidedAccess` |
| Import | Directionless | none | insert-only on enabled bits | insert-only iff `unsidedAccess` |
| Export | Directional | push to `FACING` | none | none |
| Export | Directionless | none | filtered extract-only on enabled bits | filtered extract-only iff `unsidedAccess` |

Additional rules:

- A disabled side or unavailable mode surface returns `null`, not a dummy handler.
- Mode, side, unsided, automation, or ownership changes call
  `Level.invalidateCapabilities(busPos)` after the server commits the config.
- Stable handler objects are reused while their configured capability surface remains
  available. Every call revalidates the current BlockEntity identity, escrow, loaded
  Core path, conflict, automation, filter, mode, and side. A disconnected Core makes
  a previously cached wrapper inert; it does not authorize stale storage access.
- `automationEnabled == false` disables active ticks and all capability providers.
- Active targets that implement `IStorageNetworkBlock` are always rejected.
- The queried target side is `FACING.getOpposite()` and must be re-queried after
  rotation or target invalidation.

## Filters and deterministic ordering

### Rule types

Schema 2 accepts these rule types:

1. `exact_stack`: exact item plus immutable data components (`ItemKey`).
2. `item`: registry item ID, components ignored.
3. `tag`: item tag `ResourceLocation`.
4. `mod`: exact registry namespace.
5. `resource`: one exact non-item `StorageResourceKey`, including variant data.

There is no regex, display-name, lore-text, generic NBT substring, script, or
arbitrary predicate rule.

### Evaluation

- `ALLOW`: a resource must match at least one valid rule. Empty means allow none.
- `DENY`: a resource must match no valid rule. Empty means allow all.
- Rules are checked in slots `0..8`. Duplicate rules after the first are retained
  as visible invalid entries and match nothing; they are never silently deleted.
- An invalid ID, missing item, missing tag, or unavailable addon item matches
  nothing. Raw rule data is retained so reinstalling the addon can restore it. A
  `DENY` policy containing any unavailable rule fails closed as a whole; it must
  not reinterpret the unavailable non-match as permission to export everything.
- A missing resource kind turns its schema-2 resource rule into a visible unavailable
  rule and preserves the exact raw kind/resource/variant NBT. It never falls back to
  an item representative.
- Tag membership and registry lookups use the current server registry snapshot.
  A datapack reload invalidates the compiled filter cache and increments the
  effective filter revision.

### Candidate order

- Import active item transfer keeps source-handler slot order, then applies the
  filter. Typed endpoints expose sorted exact keys and the first transferable key
  wins.
- Export checks filter slots in order. For an `exact_stack` or `item` rule, exact
  Core keys are ordered by registry ID and then canonical component encoding.
  Tag and mod rules use the same inner order.
- In `DENY` mode, allowed Core keys use that global order directly.
- Item rules never match non-item resources. Exact `resource` rules never match the
  Item kind. Generic typed capability paths reject Item keys entirely.
- The first transferable candidate wins. There is no hash-map iteration in player
  visible or transfer ordering.

The current Export single exact filter migrates to slot 0 in `ALLOW` mode. Import
starts in `DENY` mode with no rules, preserving accept-all behavior.

## Structured actor and loop isolation

`Actor.name()` is not sufficient for policy. The storage API gains a dist-neutral
structured bus actor carrying:

```text
owner UUID or explicit legacy-unclaimed marker
dimension ResourceKey
bus BlockPos
Core network UUID
operation direction: IMPORT | EXPORT
operation ID: game time plus a per-bus monotonic counter
```

A server-scoped `BusTransferGuard` wraps every active and passive operation in
`try/finally`:

- Re-entry by the same operation ID is rejected before simulation.
- A nested bus call into the same Core network is rejected when the current
  transfer already originated from that network.
- An inverse Import/Export call for the same bus and operation is rejected.
- The guard is execution-context state, not item NBT and not a global item
  cooldown heuristic.

This prevents pipes or modded handlers from recursively calling a bus capability
back into itself during `insertItem`/`extractItem`. Directionless mode has no active
scan, and directional mode rejects network blocks as targets, so neither mode can
create an autonomous unbounded self-loop. A player can still deliberately build a
bounded cross-tick ping-pong using two buses and an external inventory; each leg is
limited to one stack per cooldown and is visible in configuration. Magic Storage
does not guess player intent or tag items with provenance.

## Multiplayer access policy

This issue uses bus-local ownership rather than silently introducing a global Core
ACL that would also change terminals and remotes.

- A newly placed bus records the placing player's UUID.
- A legacy bus without an owner continues its existing automation behavior. Its
  first otherwise-valid configuration, effective Wrench rotation, or Wrench
  dismantle by a non-operator atomically assigns that player as owner before
  applying the action. A same-state or directionless rotation returns `PASS` and
  does not claim or increment revision.
  A permission-level-2 operator may act without claiming it.
- After a bus has an owner, configuration packets, mode changes, filter edits,
  Wrench rotation, and Wrench dismantling require that owner or a server operator
  with permission level 2.
- The player must also be a non-spectator, be within the normal interaction range,
  target the same loaded BlockEntity instance, have `mayBuild`, and pass the
  existing NeoForge interaction/break event. Claim/protection mods therefore keep
  their veto.
- `automationEnabled` is owner-controlled. When enabled, active and passive
  operations run as the structured bus actor; when disabled, they fail closed.
- Bus item drops preserve mode, sides, unsided setting, automation setting, and
  valid/raw filter rules, but strip the old owner. Placement assigns the new owner.
- No packet may set an arbitrary owner UUID.

This policy prevents another player from widening an Export Bus filter or side
surface while still allowing intentionally exposed hoppers/pipes to use the exact
owner-configured capability.

## Transfer protocol

Every operation uses an immutable plan containing at least:

- bus position and config revision;
- Core dimension, position, network UUID, topology revision, and conflict state;
- loaded validated bus-to-Core path;
- source/target position, block state, queried side, and capability identity;
- exact `ItemKey`, simulated count, and filter revision;
- structured actor and operation ID.

Immediately before execution, the server re-resolves or verifies every field. A
changed field cancels the plan without mutation and lets the next cooldown retry.

### Active Import

1. Resolve a currently loaded, valid, non-conflicted Core path.
2. Resolve the currently loaded front handler and iterate source slots in order.
3. Simulate source extraction of at most 64.
4. Apply the current filter and simulate exact Core insertion.
5. Capture and revalidate an immutable item plan, then execute source extraction
   only for the accepted count.
6. After the external extraction callback, revalidate the Bus/config/Core/path and
   exact endpoint block state/side/handler identity before inserting into Core.
7. If the endpoint was detached, never write the extracted stack back into that old
   handler; preserve it through the current Bus recovery path. If the endpoint is
   still current but Core accepts less after re-entrant change, return the exact
   remainder to the same source slot and recover only the amount it now rejects.
8. Independently discover the generic addon endpoint and all matching native
   fluid/FE/chemical endpoints on the same front block. For the first filtered
   non-item key, simulate bounded source extraction and Core insertion, then execute.
   Restore overdraw/remainder to the same handler; any exact amount that cannot be
   restored enters persistent Bus escrow.

### Passive Import capability

- It has one virtual empty slot, accepts insertion only, and never stores a stack.
- `getStackInSlot` and `extractItem` return empty; `isItemValid` reports only
  schema-level validity and does not replace insertion simulation.
- Simulation calls Core simulation only. Execution repeats filter, security,
  topology, and Core-capacity validation, commits only the accepted amount, and
  returns an exact copied remainder.
- The caller's input stack is never modified.
- Generic typed and native wrappers are insert-only, reject Item keys, and run the
  same filter/actor/topology validation. A pending or unsupported escrow makes both
  cached and freshly queried wrappers inert.

### Active Export

1. Resolve a currently loaded, valid, non-conflicted Core path and loaded front
   target.
2. Select the deterministic first filter candidate.
3. Simulate Core extraction of at most 64 and target insertion across target slots.
4. Capture and revalidate an immutable item plan and execute only the amount
   simulated to fit.
5. Insert into the target using actual returned remainders.
6. After the external insertion callback, revalidate the endpoint. If it was
   replaced, reverse-extract the exact accepted amount from the old target before
   restoring it to Core. Any accepted item amount the detached target refuses to
   return is conserved through the exact recovery path rather than counted as a
   successful delivery. If conflict or another re-entrant mutation makes typed
   restoration impossible, preserve that exact remainder in Bus escrow/recovery.
7. Independently visit the generic addon endpoint and all matching native typed
   endpoints. Generic discovery does not mask native capability on the same block.

### Passive Export capability

- It exists only in `DIRECTIONLESS`, only on enabled sides/null, and only while
  automation is enabled and the loaded Core path is valid.
- It is a stable one-slot, extract-only virtual view. `insertItem` always returns
  an unchanged copy and `isItemValid` is false.
- `getStackInSlot(0)` returns a safe copy of the deterministic current candidate,
  capped to its normal max stack size. It exposes no Core count beyond that copy.
- `extractItem(0, amount, simulate)` clamps to `1..64`, reselects and validates the
  current candidate, and calls Core simulate/execute with the bus actor. The
  returned stack is the exact amount extracted and is safe for the caller to own.
- No raw Core `IItemHandler`, arbitrary slot index, insertion path, or unfiltered
  extraction is reachable.
- The generic typed view and native wrappers are extract-only and exclude Item keys.

### Typed rollback escrow

- Escrow is a persistent exact-key `long` ledger, not normal Bus storage. An add is
  simulated in full before commit so `long` overflow cannot partially mutate it.
- Any pending escrow suspends cached and fresh passive item/generic/native wrappers.
- Each server tick attempts escrow recovery before checking automation or mode, so a
  disabled or directionless Bus can still return resources to its Core with the
  structured Bus actor.
- If Import's execute callback replaces its endpoint, no amount is restored into
  the detached source; every item or typed amount already extracted is preserved in
  current Bus escrow or a recovery drop. If Export's target is replaced, reversible
  accepted amount is first reclaimed from the old endpoint and returned to Core;
  an exact item deficit the detached endpoint refuses to return is emitted through
  the recovery path before any remaining amount enters escrow/recovery.
- Normal/Wrench/Creative/no-drop/explosion/replacement removal first recovers escrow
  to Core or preserves it in an owner-stripped Bus recovery drop. Every live Bus
  has a distinct recovery UUID copied into that drop. The highest-priority
  `BlockDropsEvent` handler removes escrow-bearing drops from the mutable event list
  and conserves them before later listeners; emergency recovery therefore ignores
  event cancellation and `doTileDrops=false`. The UUID deduplicates loot-first and
  `onRemove` for one Bus without merging two same-position/same-escrow removals, and
  a canceled Wrench drop event still preserves plain Bus hardware. If neither path
  can conserve the resource, removal is refused.
- Unknown-kind entries remain exact ledger data. Malformed future escrow NBT remains
  raw and disables transfer; it is never reset to empty.

## Loaded-path and capability lifecycle

- Core/path resolution keeps the current bounded BFS, cached loaded path, and
  ten-tick negative lookup backoff.
- Every cached path check verifies every member is loaded and still an
  `IStorageNetworkBlock`. No `getChunk`, `getBlockEntity`, or capability query is
  used to force-load a missing path member.
- Front target discovery first checks `hasChunkAt`/`isLoaded`.
- A `BlockCapabilityCache` may replace repeated front lookups, but is recreated
  when facing/target changes. Its invalidation listener only marks the transfer
  dirty; the next tick performs the lookup.
- Missing target, invalidated capability, unloaded chunk, stale Core, disconnected
  bus, and Core conflict all produce a no-op, not a fallback route. A configured
  provider may return the same stable wrapper while no Core is available, but every
  operation is inert until a currently loaded path resolves; mode/side surface
  changes still invalidate discovery.

## Persistence, synchronization, and migration

### Existing saves

- Import: `DIRECTIONAL`, all six side bits, `unsidedAccess=true`,
  `automationEnabled=true`, `DENY` with no rules, legacy-unclaimed owner.
- Export: `DIRECTIONAL`, all six side bits, `unsidedAccess=false`,
  `automationEnabled=true`, `ALLOW`, current exact filter in slot 0 when present,
  legacy-unclaimed owner.
- Existing `coreX/coreY/coreZ` is at most a cache hint. It never authorizes a Core
  or loads its chunk.
- Unknown future schema data is preserved raw and the bus remains disabled with a
  visible unsupported-config state. It is not reset to permissive defaults.

### Client sync

- Blockstate synchronizes facing and directional/directionless visuals.
- A server menu snapshot synchronizes mode, side mask, unsided setting,
  automation state, owner-is-current-player, filter mode/rules, invalid-rule
  markers, and config revision.
- Edits are C2S requests carrying container ID, bus position, and expected config
  revision. The server resolves the current menu/BE, checks access, validates the
  complete proposed state, commits atomically, calls `setChanged`, invalidates
  capabilities when required, and sends the new snapshot.
- Client prediction never changes transfer behavior.

## Player-facing UI and visual contract

- The screen uses one concise mode selector, six physical side toggles, one
  unsided toggle, one automation on/off control, an Allow/Deny selector, and a
  nine-slot ordered filter grid.
- Directional mode explains only "Front transfer". Directionless explains only
  "External pipes use enabled sides". Tooltips do not teach mouse gestures.
- Invalid/missing rules remain visible with a neutral unavailable marker; they do
  not turn red or disappear.
- Directional textures keep the existing cyan-in/orange-out front grammar.
  Directionless models use a neutral all-side port while keeping Import and Export
  distinguishable.
- en_us and zh_tw keys are added together. No implementation terms such as BFS,
  actor ID, capability, or rollback appear in player text.
- Any screen, blockstate, or texture change requires the deterministic Prism lab,
  current fullscreen gate, and user visual verdict. Automated tests do not approve
  layout.

## Implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Contract

This document is the required pre-production decision record.

### Phase 1 — State and migration, no behavior change

Add the versioned config, structured actor types, deterministic filter value
objects, owner capture, config revision, codecs, and migration tests. Keep active
Import/Export and current capability availability unchanged.

Implemented 2026-07-17: schema-1 config/raw preservation, exact legacy defaults,
four rule value types, placement owner, owner-stripped Export drop state, structured
actor identity, revision validation, and eight registered GameTests. This historical
slice was subsequently migrated to schema 2 and the structured actor now owns every
active/passive resource mutation.

### Phase 2 — Filter and server configuration

Add Import filtering, ordered Export candidates, atomic server menu packets,
ownership checks, and capability invalidation. Keep both buses directional.

Implemented through directional transfer wiring on 2026-07-17: immutable visible
rule states, four exact match contracts, Allow/Deny empty semantics, unsupported
fail-closed, rule-first/global deterministic candidate ordering, source-slot-order
active Import filtering, matching passive Import simulation/execution, ordered
active Export selection, and the automation-enabled gate. Runtime config reload
resets the transfer cooldown so committed policy applies immediately. Export drops
preserve owner-stripped non-exact rules. Completed 2026-07-22: the server menu now
commits whole snapshots by expected revision, owner/operator/access checks guard every
edit and Wrench action, stale menus are read-only, owner UUID never enters the client
payload, revision overflow is rejected, and capability-changing edits invalidate the
NeoForge surface.

### Phase 3 — Directionless capabilities

Add directionless Import passive-only mode and the filtered one-slot Export
extract-only handler. Prove every side/null matrix and re-entrant handler case
before adding client controls.

Implemented 2026-07-22: the complete side/null matrix, stable cached wrappers with
per-call validation, safe one-stack Export item view, generic/native typed wrappers,
structured actor propagation, recursive same-network/inverse guard, current-BE
replacement rejection, and pending-escrow suspension/recovery are covered by
registered GameTests and isolated addon/Mekanism fixtures.

### Phase 4 — Presentation and compatibility

Add the shared bus configuration screen, blockstate/models/textures, i18n,
Wrench/access integration, deterministic Prism lab fixtures, adversarial synthetic
handlers, and player-report-driven compatibility notes. Do not bundle, require, or
restrict players to an optional-mod version. The screen, directionless models, en/zh
i18n, Wrench ownership, generic addon fixture, and representative Mekanism chemical
fixture are implemented; a current fullscreen user verdict remains the release gate.
Sophisticated Storage has source-level contract coverage through NeoForge's public
item capability but no dedicated present-mod CI job yet.

## RED-first verification matrix

### Dist-neutral SelfTests

- schema-0 migration exact defaults for Import and Export;
- unknown schema preserved and disabled;
- all mode/side/null capability decisions;
- filter rule validation, duplicates, missing registry entries, exact components,
  tag reload, Allow/Deny empty semantics, and deterministic ordering;
- structured actor identity and re-entry rejection;
- config revision overflow/validation and stale update rejection;
- owner/operator/configure decisions without client classes.

### Required GameTests

- current directional Import/Export behavior is unchanged after migration;
- passive Import full/partial simulation and execution do not mutate caller input;
- active Import restores a re-entrant item remainder and escrows exact typed
  overdraw/remainder that cannot return to the source;
- one directional cooldown can move one ordinary item stack and one bounded typed
  resource independently; item success cannot suppress typed transfer;
- active Import rejects an execute stack whose exact item/components differ from
  simulation, restores that actual stack, and never inserts the simulated identity;
- active Export extracts only actual target capacity and restores item remainder or
  escrows exact typed remainder after re-entrant target refusal;
- active Import and Export reject an endpoint replaced during simulation or execute;
  Import preserves the already-extracted exact stack without touching the detached
  source, while Export reverse-reclaims accepted items and emits the exact deficit
  when the detached target refuses reclaim;
- directionless Import has no active pull and only accepts configured sides/null;
- directionless Export has no active push and exposes only filtered extraction;
- hopper insertion into Import and hopper extraction from Export obey mode, side,
  filter, and stack limits;
- synthetic handlers cover slot-order change, capability replacement, same-object
  remainder, partial execution, recursive callback, invalid slot, and over-request;
- synthetic handlers prove the public item/generic typed handler contract; the addon
  fixture proves generic+native discovery, and one representative Mekanism version
  proves present-mod chemical behavior. Production has no required optional-mod
  dependency or version pin;
- missing/conflicted Core, disconnected path, unloaded intermediate/target chunk,
  bus move, piston move, Wrench rotation, reload, and datapack tag reload fail
  closed without loading chunks;
- unauthorized configure/rotate/dismantle requests fail; owner/operator and claim
  event paths succeed exactly once;
- recursive same-network Import/Export capability callbacks terminate without
  mutation, duplication, deletion, stack overflow, or repeated BFS;
- NBT/item-component filter identities survive save/load and Wrench drop/place.
- Import and Export use the same bounded missing-Core negative cache;
- typed plans reject stale config, Core/network identity, topology revision, loaded
  path, endpoint block state/side/capability identity, including execute callbacks
  that remove or replace the Bus or its external endpoint;
- Bus escrow survives save/load/drop and is conserved across Creative no-drop,
  explosion, direct-air/programmatic replacement, `doTileDrops=false`, loot-first
  removal, canceled/later `BlockDropsEvent` listeners, disabled automation,
  directionless mode, and `long` overflow rejection; detached BlockEntities never
  receive new escrow and recovery emits one owner-stripped drop per recovery UUID,
  including two same-position removals with identical escrow;
- failed Wrench conservation preflight and no-op rotation do not claim a legacy
  owner or increment revision, while successful Wrench removal emits exactly one
  exact escrow drop and a canceled Wrench drop event still preserves a plain Bus.

- JSON/model/texture/i18n parity and `git diff --check`
- deterministic Prism scenario plus user fullscreen verdict for visual phases

## Non-goals

- No raw Core inventory capability.
- No external-machine send-and-wait or probabilistic resource protocol.
- No speed/stack/fortune/crafting upgrades.
- No active six-direction scan in directionless mode.
- No item provenance tags or heuristic cross-tick loop blacklist.
- No global Core/terminal/remote ACL redesign.
- No bundled or required Sophisticated Storage dependency.
- No player-facing external-mod version restriction or multi-version CI sweep; each
  real-mod compatibility job exercises one representative version.
- No silent downgrade when a target, addon, config schema, or capability is absent.

# Void GUI Test Lab Design

## Goal

Replace the mutable terrain-based `MagicStorageGuiTest` world with a deterministic, transactionally regenerated true-void laboratory that makes manual fullscreen GUI checks fast, spatially predictable, and repeatable.

## Chosen approach

The preparer continues to use Prism's `New World/level.dat` only as a current Minecraft/NeoForge metadata template. Before the generated world is swapped into place, it:

1. rewrites the overworld generator to `minecraft:flat`;
2. uses biome `minecraft:the_void`, one `minecraft:air` layer, no features, no lakes, and an explicitly empty structure override set;
3. removes copied chunk, entity, point-of-interest, player, scoreboard, datapack, dimension, and other runtime state, including both the `playerdata/` directory and the singleplayer snapshot embedded at `level.dat/Data/Player`;
4. installs only the generated `magic_storage_gui_test` datapack.

This is preferred over clearing a normal world at high altitude because distant terrain would still exist, and over adding a test world preset to the mod because GUI-test infrastructure must not ship in the production jar.

Malformed or unsupported `WorldGenSettings` fails before the old generated target or Prism options are changed. The existing marker check, open-world check, staging directory, atomic swap, and rollback behavior remain mandatory.

## Laboratory layout

The lab is built at Y=80 on a 37×25 neutral platform (`x=-18..18`, `z=-12..12`) with a dark border and visually separated vanilla-block lanes.

### Active network

| Target | Block position | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Storage Core | `(0,80,0)` | Single authoritative Core |
| Storage Terminal | `(-1,80,0)` | Storage grid checks |
| Crafting Terminal | `(1,80,0)` | Storage/Craftable/Fuel and recipe checks |
| T6 → T1 units | `(0,80,-1)` through `(0,80,-6)` | Connected capacity spine, total 785 types |
| Import Bus | `(-1,80,-1)`, facing west | Functional import bay |
| Import barrel | `(-2,80,-1)` | Bus source |
| Export Bus | `(1,80,-1)`, facing east | Functional export bay |
| Export barrel | `(2,80,-1)` | Bus destination |

All active network blocks are face-connected. There is exactly one connected Core.

### Isolated visual gallery

At `z=-9`, eleven disconnected samples are spaced two blocks apart from `x=-10` through `x=10`: Core, T1–T6, Storage Terminal, Crafting Terminal, Import Bus, and Export Bus. The air gap prevents the gallery Core from joining another sample or the active network, so it cannot create a multi-core conflict.

### View controls

| Hotbar key | View |
|---:|---|
| `1` | Storage Terminal |
| `2` | Crafting Terminal |
| `3` | Storage Core |
| `4` | Six-unit capacity spine |
| `5` | Import Bus and source barrel |
| `6` | Export Bus and destination barrel |
| `7` | Isolated texture gallery |
| `8` | Whole-lab overview/home |
| `9` | Rebuild the ready baseline |

Each key maps to a known `tp ... facing ...` function. A per-slot latch prevents repeated teleports and reset loops. No command block, fixed sleep, mouse automation, or chat typing is required.

## Ready baseline

The Core is placed without block-entity payload. The normal server placement path creates a fresh `CoreStorageRepository` record and writes only the resulting storage UUID/schema reference into chunk NBT.

### Stored resources

The reset baseline uses a fresh empty repository record. It does not inject inventory, energy, machine, descriptor, or legacy migration NBT into the Core. Test ingredients live in the deterministic player kit and enter the Core only through normal server-owned terminal operations.

### Stations and energy

All process and instant station slots begin empty. Axe Energy and every process/Fuel pool begin at zero. The player test kit supplies station pairs, process machines, fuels, and axes so max-one installation and finite/infinite conversion are exercised through current APIs rather than legacy NBT.

### Player kit

Hotbar slots contain semantic navigation items in fixed positions. Main-inventory slots contain three Furnaces; one Blast Furnace, Smoker, Campfire, and Brewing Stand; fuels; logs; two each of Crafting Table, Stonecutter, and Smithing Table; Smithing inputs; Cobblestone; a Remote Terminal; one plain Iron Axe; one damaged Unbreaking II Iron Axe; and one Unbreakable Iron Axe. `item replace` is used instead of `give`, so slot identity is deterministic and max-one, finite, enchantment-scaled, and infinite paths are available without manual commands.

## Bootstrap and reset

Datapack load initializes one timer objective and calls `setup`. `setup` clears the complete lab volume, removes nearby dropped items, rebuilds the platform/network/gallery, clears ready/view tags, and resets the timer. It does not immediately announce readiness.

The tick function waits three server ticks before `player_ready`. This lets scheduled network growth and block-entity loading settle without a fixed wall-clock sleep. `player_ready` applies creative/night-vision state, installs the fixed inventory, primes the current hotbar latch, teleports home, then emits `MS_GUI_TEST_READY`.

Hotbar `9` calls the same setup path. Reset is therefore the same operation as first boot, not a partial cleanup path.

## Manifest contract

The generated manifest records:

- schema version;
- true-void generator summary;
- stripped runtime paths;
- platform bounds and named zones;
- every active/gallery block and view stand/face coordinate;
- hotbar mapping;
- fresh empty Core repository baseline and zero station/consumable/process/Fuel profile;
- fixed player kit;
- bootstrap delay and reset function;
- fullscreen gate and offline launch command.

The Prism session checklist consumes target names from this manifest; it does not duplicate coordinates.

## Testing

Python tests must first fail, then cover:

1. exact flat-void NBT rewrite and a readable summary;
2. fail-closed behavior for missing/malformed worldgen compounds;
3. removal of copied runtime/chunk/datapack state and `level.dat/Data/Player` while preserving the source;
4. exact active-network and gallery coordinates;
5. plain Core placement with no inline payload, empty fixed machine slots, and zero energy;
6. deterministic player inventory and all nine hotbar semantics;
7. three-tick readiness, latch initialization, and full reset reuse;
8. no command blocks or fixed sleeps;
9. existing transaction/open-world/options/fullscreen contracts.

After the focused suite passes, run all Python tests, Gradle build, GameTest server, and datagen drift checks. The final real-client gate must prove the current jar, SelfTest, Patchouli resources, and `MS_GUI_TEST_READY`; visual approval remains owned by the user after entering fullscreen.

## Out of scope

- Production mod/world-preset code.
- Command blocks.
- A fixed list of GUI assertions for every future feature.
- Recursive magic-crafting automation.
- Preloading nonzero machine energy or process machines in the ready baseline.

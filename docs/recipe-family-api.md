# Recipe Family API

Magic Storage automatically supports recipes from any namespace when their concrete recipe class is one of the built-in exact families. Addons only need this API for a custom `RecipeType` plus custom concrete recipe class.

## Registration

Create a NeoForge deferred register during normal mod construction. One family entry covers every current and future recipe ID whose holder has that exact class and exact `RecipeType`.

```java
private static final DeferredRegister<RecipeFamily> RECIPE_FAMILIES =
        RecipeFamilyApi.createDeferredRegister(MODID);

static {
    RECIPE_FAMILIES.register("grinding", () -> RecipeFamilyFactories.singleItemToItem(
            GrindingRecipe.class,
            GRINDING_RECIPE_TYPE,
            GRINDER_DESCRIPTOR_ID,
            GrindingRecipe::input,
            (recipe, registries) -> recipe.getResultItem(registries),
            recipe -> RecipeFamilyCost.free(),
            RecipePresentationKind.STONECUTTING));
}

public ExampleMod(IEventBus modEventBus) {
    RECIPE_FAMILIES.register(modEventBus);
}
```

`GRINDING_RECIPE_TYPE` may be a `DeferredHolder`, because the factory stores the supplier and resolves it after registry registration. `GRINDER_DESCRIPTOR_ID` must already identify a registered [`MachineDescriptor`](machine-descriptor-api.md). A missing descriptor, duplicate family registry ID, or duplicate exact class/type pair fails startup instead of silently choosing one family.

## Factory contracts

### `singleItemToItem`

The first public factory is intentionally narrow:

- exact recipe class and exact `RecipeType` identity;
- one non-empty `Ingredient`, consumed once per craft;
- one deterministic output stack; item components and count are preserved exactly;
- free cost, an existing Magic Storage `EnergyCost`, descriptor-keyed station work, or station work plus Fuel through `RecipeFamilyCost.energy(...)`, `stationWork(...)`, or `stationWorkAndEnergy(...)`; amounts must be non-negative, required work must be positive, at least one energy amount must be positive, and two positive energy amounts cannot target the same pool (`free()` represents zero cost);
- one existing `RecipePresentationKind`;
- no crafting remainder, chance output, source-dependent output, fluid, player/world/event callback, or arbitrary mutation hook.

The input, output, and cost functions must be deterministic and must not mutate their recipe, arguments, registries, storage, player, or world. Magic Storage owns candidate indexing, current-holder validation, checked count multiplication, station checks, simulate-then-commit, delivery, capacity planning, and rollback. Empty input/output or invalid registration is rejected; there is no generic reflection, serializer-name, `Recipe#getIngredients()`, or EMI-widget fallback.

If a custom family does not fit this complete contract, do not approximate it with this factory. A new reusable factory must first model all inputs, outputs, components, remainders, costs, and side effects server-authoritatively. External-machine send-and-wait processing is outside this mod's installed-station magic-crafting scope.

### `deterministicResources`

Use `RecipeFamilyFactories.deterministicResources(...)` when one exact recipe resolves to a bounded `TypedRecipePlan`. The resolver receives the exact recipe and current server registries. The plan builder requires:

- one to nine exact `TypedRecipeInput` values;
- exactly one selectable primary identity: if any item primary exists, exactly one item primary is selected; otherwise the plan must contain exactly one primary resource of any registered kind;
- any additional item, fluid, power, chemical, or registered addon outputs;
- a non-empty exact presentation output and a `1..3 × 1..3` layout that fits all inputs.

Input roles are explicit. `consume` removes `amount × crafts`; `catalyst` and `tool` require the declared amount but retain it, so one retained resource may serve the whole batch. Each input may declare ordered exact alternatives with `consumeAny`/`catalystAny`/`toolAny`; consumed alternatives may additionally map each chosen key to its own remainder through `consumeAnyWithRemainders`. Overlapping CONSUME alternatives are jointly allocated by a deterministic bounded max-flow plan, so one resource cannot satisfy two requirements. Retained roles may not overlap another role because no deterministic split is defined. When the terminal's Use Player Inventory setting is enabled, item-kind typed inputs use the same exact-component source snapshot as ordinary recipes: Core is allocated first, then the visible 36 player slots are reserved by exact slot and committed only after full delivery simulation. Fluid, power, chemical, and addon-kind inputs remain Core-only. Output roles are `primary` and `remainder`; the checked result preserves those roles separately for items and typed resources. Primary items follow Player/Storage delivery and item remainders follow the existing remainder policy. A non-item selected primary is Storage-only: direct terminal crafting forces effective Storage while keeping the saved item-output preference unchanged, and Cursor/Player/EMI-inventory requests reject without mutation. Other non-item outputs return to Core. Duplicate output keys are rejected. Checked multiplication, retained-resource checks, station work/Fuel, item delivery, type capacity, and all Core item/non-item deltas are validated before one atomic ledger commit.

The recipe-addon integration test executes a two-craft typed batch with exactly one declared catalyst amount and verifies that the same amount remains afterward. Built-in exact crafting adapters independently derive container remainders from the chosen input stacks; the base GameTest suite crafts the real vanilla Cake recipe and verifies that its three Milk Buckets return exactly three empty Buckets.

Use `StorageResourceKey.item(stack, registries)`, `fluid(stack, registries)`, and `neoforgeEnergy()` for canonical built-in keys. `itemStack(...)` and `fluidStack(...)` decode exact built-in keys without dropping components. Custom kinds use their registered kind ID, stable resource ID, and canonical variant compound.

```java
RECIPE_FAMILIES.register("infusion", () -> RecipeFamilyFactories.deterministicResources(
        InfusionRecipe.class,
        INFUSION_RECIPE_TYPE,
        INFUSER_DESCRIPTOR_ID,
        (recipe, registries) -> TypedRecipePlan.builder()
                .input(TypedRecipeInput.consume(
                        StorageResourceKey.item(recipe.input(), registries), 2))
                .input(TypedRecipeInput.consume(MANA_KEY, 100))
                .input(TypedRecipeInput.catalyst(CATALYST_KEY, 1))
                .output(TypedRecipeOutput.primary(
                        StorageResourceKey.item(recipe.output(), registries), 3))
                .output(TypedRecipeOutput.remainder(MANA_KEY, 25))
                .presentationOutput(recipe.output().copyWithCount(3))
                .layout(3, 1, false)
                .build(),
        recipe -> RecipeFamilyCost.free(),
        RecipePresentationKind.STONECUTTING));
```

The resolver must be deterministic and side-effect free. Chance outputs, runtime machine polling, arbitrary Core/player/world callbacks, and external-machine send-and-wait are rejected by design. Multi-step planning remains a separate future server graph; EMI is presentation and selection only.

### `deterministicResourceVariants`

Use `RecipeFamilyFactories.deterministicResourceVariants(...)` only when one exact recipe holder can produce multiple deterministic plans from the exact item stacks currently available to the server. The resolver receives an immutable stack snapshot and registries, and returns zero or more complete `TypedRecipePlan` values under the same validation, ordering, transaction, and fail-closed rules as `deterministicResources`. It must not inspect client state or mutate its inputs. Ars Nouveau Apparatus uses this narrow path to preserve the selected reagent's exact component patch; ordinary fixed-output families should keep the simpler single-plan factory.

The overload without an eligibility predicate retains the global fail-closed rule for `Recipe#isSpecial()`. Some third-party public exact recipe classes report `isSpecial()` despite exposing a complete deterministic contract. Only the overload with an explicit `Predicate<R> eligibility` may opt that exact class/type into special-recipe support; the predicate must reject unsupported output shapes, overflow, chance/per-tick semantics, or any other non-deterministic member. This does not relax special handling for any other family.

## Current optional integrations

- **Iron Furnaces:** contributes concrete Furnace station variants; recipes remain the existing exact smelting family while rate comes from live configured cook time. Recipe-viewer ownership stays with Iron Furnaces: its JEI plugin registers Smelting catalysts and the GUI support pack uses TMRV to expose them to EMI without installing JEI. Magic Storage never registers third-party EMI workstations.
- **Farmer's Delight:** Cooking Pot plans include 1–6 ingredients, exact serving container, alternative-specific container remainders, `cookTime` station work, matching Furnace Fuel, and one fixed item output.
- **Mekanism:** all nine factory-backed families are present. Crushing, Enriching, and Smelting use sized one-item inputs; Combining uses two sized item inputs; Compressing, Purifying, Injecting, and Infusing use sized item + chemical inputs; deterministic Sawing accepts no random secondary output, or an exact 100% secondary remainder. Per-tick chemical use is normalized across the basic machine's 200-tick work cost with checked multiplication. Pressurized Reaction uses sized item/fluid/chemical inputs, checked `energyRequired × duration` FE, duration station work, and deterministic item-primary, item-plus-chemical, or chemical-only output. The deterministic single-block extension adds Chemical Oxidizer, Chemical Infuser, Electrolytic Separator, Chemical Dissolution Chamber, Chemical Washer, Chemical Crystallizer, Isotopic Centrifuge, Antiprotonic Nucleosynthesizer, Pigment Extractor, Pigment Mixer, and Painting Machine. Their exact Mekanism ingredient amounts and item/fluid/chemical outputs use one typed transaction. The 5-second/10-second machine durations, recipe-specific Nucleosynthesizer duration, checked per-tick chemical multiplication, one-operation-per-tick families, and Electrolysis energy multiplier are preserved as descriptor work costs. Electrolysis commits both chemical outputs atomically; one is the selectable primary and the second is a deterministic remainder output. Chemical/fluid-only selection preserves the exact resource key and amount and is Storage-only. Probabilistic Sawing and unsupported output shapes remain fail closed. The owning Mekanism mod remains responsible for EMI workstation metadata.
- **Botania:** exact common Mana Infusion, Runic Altar, Terrestrial Agglomeration, Petal Apothecary, and Elven Trade classes each require their matching installed instant station. Mana Infusion retains its supported block catalyst; Runic Altar retains catalyst ingredients and returns exact crafting remainders; Petal Apothecary consumes 1000 units of stored water; Elven Trade commits every fixed output. Mana, water, items, catalysts, remainders, and outputs use one typed transaction. The plan stays within the shared nine-input contract and rejects unsupported custom ingredient/state semantics rather than approximating them.
- **Ars Nouveau:** Imbuement consumes its center input and Source while retaining pedestal catalysts. Enchanting Apparatus consumes its reagent and ordinary pedestal ingredients, retains tagged catalysts, returns exact crafting remainders, and uses `deterministicResourceVariants` only when the output must preserve the exact reagent component patch. Both require their installed process station and reject dynamic/world-dependent or over-nine-input plans.
- **EvilCraft:** Blood Infuser consumes an optional exact item and/or exact Blood amount, retains a required Promise tier, consumes recipe duration as station work, and emits one exact item output. XP, tag-selected outputs, unsupported tiers, live modifier combinations, and Purifier actions fail closed.
- **Powah:** Energizing consumes one to six exact items plus scaled NeoForge Energy, uses the same scaled amount as station work, and derives each installed rod tier rate from loaded Powah config. Dynamic/custom inputs, non-positive energy, physical warm-up, and world links fail closed.
- **Industrial Foregoing:** Dissolution Chamber plans consume grouped exact item slots, sized fluid, live-config FE, and station work while preserving deterministic item/fluid outputs. Material Stonework Factory plans preserve water/lava catalysts or consume exact full thresholds; Crusher accepts only one exact deterministic output. Partial thresholds, laser/extractor world state, custom output callbacks, and ambiguous outputs fail closed.
- **Create:** Milling, Crushing, and Cutting consume one exact item plus recipe duration; Filling consumes exact item + fluid; Emptying returns exact item + fluid. All outputs must be deterministic and all five stations use normalized station work. Chance, heat, RPM-dependent, multi-station, tool-durability, world-catalyst, Mechanical Crafting, and Sequenced Assembly shapes fail closed.
- **PneumaticCraft:** present-mod CI intentionally registers no family. Pressure Chamber, Thermo Plant, Fluid Mixer, Assembly, Refinery, Heat Frame, and Explosion payloads depend on retained pressure/heat/multiblock/world state or non-simulatable Air mutation that the current exact transaction contract cannot represent.

Mekanism 10.7.19 still has two explicit fail-closed boundaries. A one-way Rotary recipe is supported in either fluid-to-chemical or chemical-to-fluid direction, but the shipped recipes put both directions in one `BasicRotaryRecipe`; the current one-plan-per-holder API cannot condition output on the selected input, so bidirectional Rotary recipes are rejected instead of duplicating output. Nutritional Liquifier recipes are synthetic `NutritionalLiquifierIRecipe` values whose `getType()` and `getSerializer()` are both `null` and which never enter the server `RecipeManager`. Their fluid output and optional container remainder therefore cannot be safely exposed by a registered exact recipe family. The representative fixture uses Mushroom Stew to prove the synthetic recipe returns both Nutritional Paste and the exact `usingConvertsTo()` Bowl; an ordinary crafting remainder alone is not this API contract. Supporting those two shapes requires a conditional-plan/synthetic-recipe discovery API rather than a Mekanism-only fallback.

All nine recipe compatibility modules load only after `ModList` confirms the target mod. One representative artifact per mod is used in CI without restricting player metadata to that exact version. Botania's current official `455-SNAPSHOT` CI artifact is accepted only when its resolved jar matches the expected build31 SHA-256; this is reproducible test evidence, not a player dependency pin. See [`botania-compatibility.md`](botania-compatibility.md).

## Lifecycle and sides

- Register on the mod event bus before NeoForge registries freeze. Magic Storage freezes and validates its immutable adapter snapshot at common setup; runtime hot registration is unsupported.
- The recipe-family registry is server policy. Dedicated servers never load EMI or screen classes through this API.
- External families are ordered after built-ins and then by full registry ID. Addons cannot supply a priority or shadow a built-in exact class/type pair.
- A CI-tested addon version is representative evidence only. Addon metadata should use the compatibility range it actually supports rather than copying a single CI artifact version as an exact player-facing pin.

## Repository verification fixture

`src/apiTest/` proves both factories, the explicit-eligibility overload, and the resource kind/handler/block/container APIs compile from a different Java package. `src/recipeAddonFixture/` is a separately loaded NeoForge mod with 17 GameTests covering the legacy single-item family, polymorphic/fractional station work and selection-relative installed-first preview cycling, typed overlapping alternatives and alternative-specific remainders, retained roles, exact counts, mixed item/addon/fluid commit, terminal listing and held-container transfer, generic+native Bus discovery, persistent typed rollback escrow, Creative removal conservation, destination capacity rejection, and rollback. The representative Mekanism fixture has 47 GameTests, including all nine basic/factory descriptor variants and rates, exact factory throughput, item-chemical families, deterministic/probabilistic Sawing boundaries, exact chemical-only listing/preview/Storage commit, explicit non-item destination rejection, long-overflow atomic no-op, eleven additional deterministic single-block families, both safe one-way Rotary directions, bidirectional Rotary rejection, and the Nutritional null-type registration boundary; the complete 22-of-26 recipe-type accounting is in [`mekanism-compatibility.md`](mekanism-compatibility.md). The representative Botania fixture has 12 GameTests covering conditional Mana registration, local Tablet transfer/rejections, five installed stations, exact retained catalysts/remainders/water/multi-output transactions, overflow rollback, station gating, nine-input fail-closed behavior, and excluded unsafe families. The representative Farmer's Delight fixture has 7 GameTests, including enabled/disabled player-inventory typed inputs and full-destination atomic rollback. The representative Modern Industrialization fixture has 6 GameTests for 14 direct machine families, provider rates, exact item/fluid/EU/catalyst/multi-output transactions, persistence, rejection, and rollback. The representative Ars Nouveau fixture has 10 GameTests for Source transfer/persistence, Imbuement/Apparatus batching, exact components/remainders, station work, rejection, and rollback. The representative EvilCraft fixture has 9 GameTests for Blood fluid behavior, terminal persistence, Blood Infuser registration, Promise tiers, deterministic recipes, rejection, and rollback. The representative Powah fixture has 9 GameTests for live Energizing Rod rates, standard FE capability behavior, terminal persistence, official and six-input Energizing recipes, batching, and atomic shortage/overflow rollback. The representative Industrial Foregoing fixture has 9 GameTests for live configured rates, Dissolution item/fluid/FE/work plans, Stonework catalyst/consumption rules, deterministic Crusher output, persistence, rollback, and unsafe-family rejection. The representative Create fixture has 12 GameTests for five deterministic families, exact item/fluid/remainder/output/work transactions, station reload, duplicate-output merge, shortage/overflow rollback, and unsafe-family rejection. The representative PneumaticCraft fixture has 8 GameTests proving the real mod loads while Air registration and every audited unsafe machine family remain fail closed. Public handler/strategy simulation and amount rules are authoritative in [`typed-resource-storage.md`](typed-resource-storage.md#public-handler-and-strategy-contract).
